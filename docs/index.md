# TracePy - Optical Design in Python

<img src="./images/tracepy_logo.png" alt="drawing" width="470"/>

# Overview

TracePy is a sequential ray tracing package written in Python for designing optical systems in the geometric optics regime. TracePy features lens optimization from Scipy. TracePy is currently in active development and any collaborators would be welcome.

## Installation

To use TracePy I suggest cloning the repository and using the command "pip install ." in the downloaded directory. You can also download TracePy directly through pypi with the command below.

```
pip install tracepy
```

## Examples

To get started using the software, I suggest looking at the examples provided in the examples folder. The UI for TracePy is most similar to BEAM4, and TracePy's ray tracing algorithm was recreated mostly from Spencer and Murty's iconic paper, "General Ray-Tracing Procedure".

## Contributing

I would suggest reading Spencer and Murty's paper, ["General Ray-Tracing Procedure"](https://www.osapublishing.org/josa/viewmedia.cfm?uri=josa-52-6-672&seq=0) for an overview of TracePy's algorithm. If you have any questions feel free to contact me at gavinniendorf@gmail.com.
